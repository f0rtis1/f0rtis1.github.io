## Quizbot functionality
Let's take a quick look at what quizbot does. When we join the channel, it welcomes us with the following message:

So the first important thing quizbot can do is ***assign a role*** depending on what emoji you react with.

The second feature of quizbot is taking a quiz:

As we can see, upon completing the quiz, the bot sends a message with our name in it. 

```Thank you, fortis1```

That is super interesting - whenever an application returns your input in some way, it is worth looking more into.

## Exploiting the bot

In the source code we find ```on_raw_reaction_add()``` function - it is called whenever we react on ***any*** of the bot's messages. 

```python
@client.event
async def on_raw_reaction_add(event):
    emoji = event.emoji
    user = client.get_user(event.user_id)
    member = guild.get_member(event.user_id)
    channel = client.get_channel(event.channel_id)
    message = await channel.fetch_message(event.message_id)

    if (
        message.author != client.user
        or user == client.user
    ):
        return

    lines = message.content.split("\n")[1:]
    for line in lines:
        try:
            line_reaction, role_name = line.strip().split(" ", 1)
        except ValueError:
            continue

        if str(emoji) == line_reaction:
            role = discord.utils.get(guild.roles, name=role_name)
            if member:
                await member.add_roles(role)
```

Basically, it splits the message that received a reaction by ```newline```, ignores the first line, and then from every other line gets the first two strings: `reaction` and `role`. Taking welcoming message as an example, a line would be:

```
ðŸ‘¶ Thoroughly research and solve the challengee
```

If the emoji a user reacted with matches the  `reaction` that's in the line, quizbot assign the corresponding `role`. Now, the function was clearly made for the purpose of welcoming message. But what would happen if we reacted on a *quiz* message?

Well ... nothing, really. The function is triggered but there are no lines with emojis to split and check. But if we could format the message properly, we could force *quizbot* to assign us any role we want - like ***admin***.

Yessir! After reacting to bot's message with ðŸ¦‰ emoji, we are given a new role:

And we have access to a secret admin-only channel with the flag:
