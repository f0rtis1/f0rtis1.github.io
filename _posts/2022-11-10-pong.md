## Playing by the rules?

Let's take a look at the website:

The website lets us play a classic game of [pong](https://www.ponggame.org/). We can begin the match by pressing ```P``` to serve and then move the left paddle up and down with ```W``` and ```S```. As simple as it is, pong is a pretty cool game. However, the challenege description was kind of right - you cannot really beat AI controlled paddle. At least not the intended way.


## We do a little cheating

This version of pong is mostly a client-side rendering game. We can see the code responsible for playing the game in [*index.html* file](https://github.com/cscosu/buckeyectf-2022-public/blob/master/web/pong/index.html). When you open the webpage, ```draw()```  function draws the game canvas and from this time on ```setInterval(tick, 13)``` makes sure that every 13 milliseconds ```tick()``` function is triggered to update the state of the game which then re-draws the whole canvas at the end with ```draw()``` .

The reason you cannot beat the AI is because the right paddle ```y position``` will always match position of the ball (```p2 = by```):

```javascript
// tick() function
// controls
if(p1 - up * .01 > pl / 2) p1 -= up * .01;
if(p1 + down * .01 < 1 - pl / 2) p1 += down * .01;
p2 = by;
```
Okay, so we know there is no way to beat the AI in a fair game. But what if we wanted to **cheat** a little? Let's take a look at how the game awards points for scoring. 

```javascript
// tick() function
if(bx < -.1 || bx > 1.1) {
    socket.emit("score", bx);
}
```
The game takes horizontal position of the ball (```bx```) and checks if it exceeded the boundaries of the game. If  ```bx``` is less that ```-0.1``` then the ball flew off the left side of the screen (point for AI) and if ```bx```  is more than ```1.1``` then the ball flew off the right side of the screen (we scored a point). However, **point scoring happens server side** - the client only informs the server with ```socket.emit("score", bx)``` that the ball was in either of scoring positions. 

Right, so what would happen if triggered ```socket.emit("score", 1.2)``` manually, from developer console? This would make server believe that we actually scored a point.

Yep! That's exactly what happend. Just for the sake of testing, let's call ```socket.emit("score", -0.2)``` to see if AI will be awarded the point.

Point for AI, just as expected. So now we can either call ```socket.emit("score", 1.2)``` a bunch of times or just put in a ```for loop``` to win the game and get the flag.
